<ArticleParagraph
  articlePText={`In Berlin, analogue photobooths aren't just machines—they're part of the city's street culture. Scattered across Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, these booths catch friendships, nights out, and random moments in grainy black-and-white strips you can hold in your hand. The wait, the flash, the chemical smell—it's all part of the ritual.`}

<ArticleParagraph
  articlePText={`Today, the walls are layered with stories told in paint and paste-ups, 
  mixing political commentary and sharp urban wit. The alley and surrounding buildings are
  not polished or curated for visitors - they're messy, powerful, and beautifully real. 
    If you want a glimpse of Berlin that doesn't come with a price tag or glossy filter, 
  this is where you'll find it.`}
