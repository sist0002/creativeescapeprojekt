<ArticleParagraph
  articlePText={`Haus Schwarzenberg isn't just another stop on the tourist map - 
  it's a living, breathing canvas of history and rebellion. Once an early 20th-century
  industrial complex that survived World War II, 
  it later became a refuge for underground artists and free thinkers.`}

<ArticleParagraph
  articlePText={`Today, the walls are layered with stories told in paint and paste-ups, 
  mixing political commentary and sharp urban wit. The alley and surrounding buildings are
   not polished or curated for visitors - they're messy, powerful, and beautifully real. 
    If you want a glimpse of Berlin that doesn't come with a price tag or glossy filter, 
  this is where you'll find it.`}
