  <ArticleParagraph
    articlePText={`Everyone flocks to the Little Mermaid statue, only to be underwhelmed by the tiny bronze figure surrounded by selfie sticks. If you're looking for something more authentic — and more powerful — head a little further into Copenhagen's cultural heart.`}

  <ArticleParagraph
    articlePText={`Just by the Black Diamond (the striking black marble and glass extension of the Royal Danish Library), you'll find Havfrue (The Mermaid), created in 1921 by the artist couple Carl Nielsen and Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen. Unlike the polished fairytale figure at Langelinie, this mermaid isn't about Disney dreams. She's rugged, muscular, almost unsettling — a figure that feels closer to myth than mascot.`}

  <ArticleH3 articleH3Text="What can you expect when visiting Haus Schwarzenberg?" />

  <ArticleParagraph
    articlePText={`Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, one of Denmark's pioneering female sculptors, captured the raw tension between human and sea creature. Together with her husband Carl Nielsen, Denmark’s most famous composer, the work is a rare artistic collaboration that fuses music, sculpture, and myth.
Standing by the water, Havfrue reflects Copenhagen's creative identity: bold, unpolished, and alive with contradictions.`}

  <ArticleParagraph
    articlePText={`Just behind the statue lies the Black Diamond: part library, part cultural venue, part architectural statement. Its glass façade mirrors the harbor, making it a living artwork.`}
