1. Hackesche Höfe  
This iconic complex of eight interconnected courtyards in Mitte is a treasure trove of Jugendstil architecture, galleries, indie boutiques, theaters, cafés, and more. Wander through the arched façades and decorative tiles (courtesy of August Endell), and you'll find yourself in a living, breathing art installation at every turn.`}

From multi-courtyard grandeur to compact and expressive, you'll find creativity pulsing through these spaces:  
Haus Schwarzenberg is full of street art, galleries, and creative hangouts—a snapshot of Berlin's underground soul.  
Rosenhöfe, tucked nearby, is the opposite vibe—serene and quietly enchanting, with soft architectural details and peaceful solitude.`}

Each courtyard tells a story.  
They are little pockets of calm: perfect for sketching, daydreaming, reading, or collab chats away from the tourist track.`}
