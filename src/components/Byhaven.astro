<ArticleParagraph>
  Byhaven, located right next to Vesterport, has become one of Copenhagen’s most talked-about
  summer hangouts. All season long – including September – the courtyard turns into an open-air
  stage with free concerts almost every week.

<ArticleParagraph>
  For many young Copenhageners, it’s the perfect mix: discovering upcoming artists, hanging out
  with friends, and soaking in the atmosphere without paying a single krone.

  We asked a young Copenhagen resident what makes Byhaven special. His take:  
  "Honestly, I love following their Instagram – it feels fresh and professional. And the fact that
  they host free concerts all summer is just amazing. It’s one of the few places where you can
  still stumble upon new music without needing a ticket."
