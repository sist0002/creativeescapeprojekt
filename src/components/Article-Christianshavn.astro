  articlePText={` Sure, Nyhavn looks great on a postcard — but let's be real: it's where every tourist goes. Packed cafés, overpriced drinks, and selfie sticks everywhere. If you want to experience Copenhagen in a more local way, skip Nyhavn and head over to Christianshavn instead.`}

  articlePText={`You'll still get the canals, the colorful old houses, and boats lined up along the water, but without the overwhelming crowds. Christianshavn has a calmer, laid-back vibe that feels like a mix between city and small town — perfect for a relaxed walk, grabbing a coffee to-go, or just sitting by the water and watching life float by.`}

  articlePText={`In Christianshavn, you'll find the neighborhood Christiania, an independent town tucked away from the corporate world. Also known as  “Freetown”, this village was founded in the 60’s and still remains an independent village. You'll find colorful hand-built houses, independent cafes, restaurant, venues, a local sauna etc.`}
